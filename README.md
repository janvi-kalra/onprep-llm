# onprem-llm

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to onprem llm: an infrastructure to chat with your data on premises ensuring privacy.

Think: ChatGPT but OpenAI no longer has access to the questions you input. That way, companies cannot sell this data, and you can ask ChatGPT your deepest darkest secrets :) Oh and your company's intellectual property is safe too
